# IMDB-sentiment-classifier
This is a basic sentiment analysis project I built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model takes in a movie review and predicts whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

# What it does
- Loads the IMDB dataset (comes with Keras)

- Preprocesses the text (tokenizes and pads the sequences)

- Trains a neural network on 25,000 reviews

- Evaluates the model on a separate 25,000 test reviews

- Lets you test your own custom review

# Accuracy
The model reaches around 85% accuracy on the test set.
I used a simple architecture with an embedding layer and a dense neural net.

# Tools and Libraries
- Python

- TensorFlow / Keras

- NumPy

# How to run
- Open the notebook in Google Colab (or any environment of your choice)

- Run the cell (I did the entire code in only one cell)

- Try editing the last line to enter your own review

# Why I made this
I'm learning machine learning and NLP, and this is one of my first real projects. It helped me understand how text data can be turned into numbers and used to train a model.
